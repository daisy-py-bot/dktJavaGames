# Hangman Game

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a hidden word letter by letter. Each incorrect guess results in part of a stick figure being drawn. The objective is to guess the word before the entire stick figure is completed, hence "hanging" the man.


## Features

Dynamic selection of words from a predefined list or command-line arguments.
Interactive gameplay with user prompts for letter guesses.
Error handling for invalid inputs.
Display of correct letters when guessed and tracking of incorrect guesses.
End-game detection to reveal the word and display the number of misses.
How to Play

Compile the Hangman.java file.
Run the compiled .class file using the Java Virtual Machine.
Follow the on-screen prompts to guess letters in the hidden word.
Guess letters one at a time until the word is revealed or the man is hanged.

You can customize the word list by editing the wordList array in the code.
Alternatively, you can pass custom words as command-line arguments when running the program.
